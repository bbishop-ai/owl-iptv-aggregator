# Owl IPTV Aggregator

A set-and-forget, GitHub-hosted M3U + XMLTV pipeline for Owl IP Player. This fork audits the operational source definitions in `cs3306/IPTV-sources`, `HerbertHe/iptv-sources`, and `walke2019/iptv-api-two`, builds their canonical superset, filters for configured languages, validates streams, collapses conservative duplicates, ranks primary/backup choices, matches EPG, and deploys only a sane fresh build.

It does not supply credentials, decrypt DRM, bypass paywalls, or turn LAN-only multicast into public streams. Use only streams you are entitled to access.

## Stable URLs

After GitHub Pages is enabled for **GitHub Actions**, use:

- Playlist: `https://bbishop-ai.github.io/owl-iptv-aggregator/playlist.m3u`
- XMLTV: `https://bbishop-ai.github.io/owl-iptv-aggregator/epg.xml`
- Build stats: `https://bbishop-ai.github.io/owl-iptv-aggregator/stats.json`

The M3U includes both `url-tvg` and `x-tvg-url`, but Owl's current public listing only documents adding an XMLTV source separately; it does not promise automatic header discovery. In Owl, add the playlist URL, then add the XMLTV URL as its EPG source. This is the reliable setup.

## Pipeline

`sources → fetch/cache → parse → normalize metadata → classify language → filter → staged validation → quality analysis → identity normalization → conservative dedupe → rank → primary/backup → EPG match → generate → sanity check → atomic Pages deploy`

Every scheduled run builds in a staging directory. Failed downloads can use cached source bodies, validation results are reused for 24 hours, media inspection is capped, and deployment only begins after tests and sanity checks. A failed build leaves the prior Pages deployment untouched.

## Configuration

Edit `config/pipeline.yml`:

- `filter.languages`: ISO-639-1 codes; defaults to `[en]`.
- `filter.allow_unknown`: defaults to `true`. Unknown-language rows are admitted cautiously because many playlists omit language metadata. Set it to `false` for strict English metadata only.
- `validation.deep_probe_limit`: limits expensive ffprobe/frozen-frame checks.
- `dedupe.backups_per_channel`: defaults to one backup per normalized identity.
- `publish.minimum_channels`: production floor. Raise this after the first successful run to detect severe regressions.
- `publish.epg_url`: the stable URL embedded in the M3U header.

`config/sources.json` is generated from the audit. Each canonical input records all declaring repositories and original wrapped URLs. Cloud-incompatible discovery and multicast inputs remain inventoried but disabled; this is explicit, not omission.

## Upstream audit and adding sources

The checked-in audit records repository commit SHAs, every operational URL occurrence, the canonical source list, and the exact set difference. To reproduce against current upstream heads:

```sh
python -m tools.audit_upstreams --output .
pytest -q
```

For a deliberate local-only source, add a unique record to `config/sources.json`. For changes originating in any of the three audited repositories, rerun the audit instead of editing generated entries. Review `audit/source_diff.json` and commit all three generated files together.

## GitHub setup

1. Open **Settings → Pages** and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
2. Open **Actions → Build and publish IPTV → Run workflow** for the first build.
3. Confirm the Pages deployment and `stats.json`, then set `publish.minimum_channels` to a sensible floor below the observed `published_streams` count.
4. Add the stable playlist and XMLTV URLs to Owl.

The workflow runs at minute 17 every six hours and also supports manual dispatch. `refresh_audit` refreshes the three-repository source inventory during a manual run; normal scheduled runs keep the reviewed, repeatable config stable.

## Validation and ranking

Validation borrows the strongest practical ideas from the three bases: concurrent availability/latency checks, resolution probing, bounded download/media inspection, cached results, and normalized-name grouping. A five-second sampled frame hash flags a truly static video sample as frozen. Ranking prefers playable, non-frozen, higher-resolution, higher-frame-rate, HTTPS, lower-latency streams. Exact URL variants are removed first; channel identities use `tvg-id` when present and a conservative normalized name otherwise. One primary plus one backup is published where available.

EPG matching is deterministic: exact `tvg-id`, unique normalized-name match, then only an unambiguous high-threshold fuzzy match. The published XMLTV contains matched channels and their programmes, keeping it smaller for a TV device.

## Troubleshooting

- **Owl shows channels but no guide:** add `epg.xml` separately in Owl. Confirm channel `tvg-id` values appear as XMLTV channel IDs.
- **Too many non-English channels:** set `allow_unknown: false`. Many source playlists omit reliable language tags, so this trades recall for precision.
- **Too few channels:** inspect `stats.json` source failures and validation counts. Do not lower the sanity floor until the cause is understood.
- **A run fails:** the last Pages deployment remains live. Rerun manually; source bodies and recent validations are cached.
- **FFmpeg timeouts:** reduce `deep_probe_limit` or validation concurrency. Cheap availability checks still cover all candidate URLs.
- **Multicast streams absent:** the walke2019 maps are LAN/provider-network inputs and intentionally disabled on GitHub runners.
